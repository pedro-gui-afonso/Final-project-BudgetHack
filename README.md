# Description:

BudgetHack - Expenses Track&Split System is a personal expense tracker and smart-expense splitting system through integration of OCR and AI technologies 
It allows users to upload their printed (jpg, png, pdf) or handwritten bills to the system. The system utilizes OCR technology (Cloud Vision) to extract text from the uploaded images and then utilizes OpenAI to filter and interpret the relevant data such as type, amount, date and location. As output the system provides visualizations of the expenses by type, allowing users to see a breakdown of their spending habits. Additionally, the system calculates the optimal way to split expenses among group members, minimizing the number of transactions.
