# BudgetHack

# Description:

BudgetHack - Expenses Track&Split System is a personal expense tracker and smart-expense splitting system through integration of OCR and AI technologies. 
It allows users to upload their printed (jpg, png, pdf) or handwritten bills to the system. The system utilizes OCR technology (Cloud Vision) to extract text from the uploaded images and then utilizes OpenAI to filter and interpret the relevant data such as type, amount, date and location. As output the system provides visualizations of the expenses by type, allowing users to see a breakdown of their spending habits. Additionally, the system calculates the optimal way to split expenses among group members, minimizing the number of transactions.

# Tools:
Besides CloudVision and OpenAI, the application is built using Python as the backend programming language, Flask as the web framework for handling server-side logic and routing, and HTML/CSS for the frontend user interface. Flask serves as the backbone for routing HTTP requests and responses. HTML provides the structure and content of web pages, while CSS stylesheets enhance the presentation and layout.
